# GrowGuide

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

GrowGuide is a modern, AI-powered online learning platform where users can create, browse, and enroll in dynamic courses. It integrates Google Gemini AI to autogenerate course content, Clerk.dev for authentication, and uses PostgreSQL (via Drizzle ORM) for scalable, real-time data handling.

First, clone this repo and install dependencies:

First, run the development server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vaishnaviii03/growguide.git
cd growguide

npm install

or
yarn install

or
pnpm install
```


Next, create a `.env.local` file with your keys (Clerk, Gemini API, PostgreSQL).

Then, run the development server:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
